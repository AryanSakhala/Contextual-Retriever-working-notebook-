This is a complete notebook for you to refer `Contextual Retrieval` using `VLLM`.

Set VLLM and 
* Instead of <YOUR_API_URI> use the address where VLLM is hosted.
* Make sure to set the correct model and max_tokens.
* Make sure to change or set the correct `prompt_template` according to your use case.
* Set up Milvus Vector DB and make sure it's running.


Good Luck!
